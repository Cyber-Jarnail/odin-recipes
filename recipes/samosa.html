    <ul>Peppers</ul>
    <ul>The love for good food!</ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>Begin by mixing oil and fluor followed by kneeding the dough.</p>
    <p>Let the dough sit for about 30 minutes and in the mean time prepare the stuffing.</p>
    <p>Stuffing includes potatoes and peppers.  Boil the potatoes and chop the peppers.</p>
    <p>Once the potatoes are done, mash them.</p>
    <p>Now mix the potatoes and peppers together.</p>
    <p>Now take the dough and divide it (how many will depend on how many you want to make).</p>
    <p>Take each piece of dough and flatten it into a circle.</p>
    <p>Take flattened dough and cut it in half.  Now shape each half of the dough into a cone.</p>
    <p>Repeat with other pieces of dough.</p>
    <p>Take the mix of potatoes and peppers and stuff them into the dough.  Don't overfill.</p>
    <p>Close the open end of the dough by squeezing the edges together.</p>
    <p>Heat oil into a fry pan.  Drop a piece of dough to see if the oil is ready.  The dough should float back up once cooked.</p>
    <p>Insert the samosas into the oil, few at a time.  Cook until they are a golden brown.</p>
    <p>Once finished they can be eaten by themselves, ketchup or chutney.</p>
